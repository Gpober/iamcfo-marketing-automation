<p>You're looking at the bank balance.<br>
You're looking at the bills due.<br>
You're trying to do the math in your head.</p>

<p>"Can I afford this hire?"<br>
"Should I wait another month?"<br>
"What if that big invoice doesn't come in?"</p>

<p>Every business owner asks these questions.<br>
But most are flying blind with spreadsheets and guesswork.</p>

<p><strong>I AM CFO shows you the answer in real-time:</strong></p>

<p>‚úÖ Today's actual cash position (not last month's)<br>
‚úÖ Your burn rate this week (see where money's going)<br>
‚úÖ Cash flow forecast (know what's coming in and out)<br>
‚úÖ Profit by location, service, or product (know what's working)</p>

<p>One {industry} company used I AM CFO to discover they had $47K more cash available than they thought. They made the hire. Best decision they made.</p>

<p>Another found they were losing $3K/month on their most popular service. Adjusted pricing. Turned it around in 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>Real-time cash flow visibility = Better decisions.</strong></p>

        'solution': "I AM CFO shows you real-time cash flow by job. You'll know exactly what you can bid without putting the business at risk.",

        'subject': "Why does cash feel tighter than sales suggest?",
        'opening': "Sales are up. But somehow, cash is still tight. What's going on?",
        'pain': "Food costs fluctuate. Labor scheduling is a puzzle. Some locations feel more profitable than others, but which ones?",
        'question': "Where is your cash actually going?",
        'solution': "I AM CFO shows real-time P&L by location and tracks your actual food cost percentage daily.",

        'opening': "You've got 8 properties. Some feel profitable. Some don't. But which ones actually are?",
        'pain': "Maintenance costs spike unexpectedly. Vacancy rates change. Some properties just seem to eat cash.",
